Exercise 1.1: Team Projects

1. Interesting and Trackable: Calvin Rank: This application would use a database to track
all available food and drink items in the dining halls, Johnny’s, and Peet’s. Students who
download the app can rank foods based on taste, nutrient density, and more. For
example, in my freshman year, there was one instance in which 3 of my friends got food
poisoning from a specific grilled ham and cheese sandwich. Despite the sandwich’s
unpopularity, it was back the next week. This application could be useful for campus food
hubs because evaluating rankings may reduce food waste. Foods that are not popular
can be phased out or made in lesser quantities. This application may also increase the
purchase of meal plans. Upperclassmen may be incentivized to buy a meal plan if they
can reasonably rely on good food without having to risk spending thousands of dollars a
year on hated unpopular meals.

2. Wacky: The Ideal Candidate: Are you someone who wants to, for lack of a better term,
lookmaxx? Do you have a job interview lined up but don’t know how to clean up properly?
Don’t worry, the Ideal Candidate can help you! This application scans your face or body
and uses AI tools to give you suggestions on outfits, hairstyles, makeup styles, shaving
advice, and more. Greasy hair and no time to wash it? The Ideal Candidate can help! It
will tailor its advice based on your specifications and abilities to change. Don’t worry, the
Ideal Candidate will never suggest plastic surgery or weight loss/gain. The Ideal
Candidate offers hygienic advice that should be possible to do in an hour or less. Spend
more time studying your Leetcode and let the Ideal Candidate take care of the rest.
